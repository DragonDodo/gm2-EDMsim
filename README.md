# gm2-EDMsim

Python simulation code for g-2 EDM studies, without the faff of running the official code. 

# Main options: 
1. Option: main running mode. Three options:
      - None: plots one snapshot at a fixed angle combination. 
      - GM2: plots a g-2 wiggle plot time histogram using the energy cut method
      - EDM: plots the average vertical angle as a function of time. 
2. n_muons: The number of muons to generate per datapoint. Total number of muons will vary between modes depending on number of points chosen. 
3. npoints:for EDM and GM2 modes, number of points to plot.
