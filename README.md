# gm2-EDMsim, aka EDaMame

Python simulation code for g-2 EDM studies, without the faff of running the official code. 

# Main options: 
1. Option: main running mode. Two options:
      - GM2: dataset binned in time for g-2 precession with an energy cut
      - EDM: data binned in time for EDM oscillation (mean vertical angle method)
      - test: used for a single time snapshot, good for debugging
2. n_events: the total number of events to generate. 
3. t_start and t_end: define the time range over which to generate events. 

# WiggleFitter.py

Run this on the output text files generated by gm2Sim to fit the wiggle plot or vertical angle oscillation. Calculates parameters, their errors, and the chi-squared of the fit. If the input files have no injected EDM signal, will also calculate the limit set on the EDM by the generate data. 

# gm2.mplstyle 

This is the official matplotlib style file for the g-2 experiment, needed to make the plots look nice.
