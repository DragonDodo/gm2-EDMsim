# gm2-EDMsim, aka EDaMame

Python simulation code for g-2 EDM studies, without the faff of running the official code. 

# Main options: 
1. Option: main running mode. Two options:
      - GM2: plots a g-2 wiggle plot time histogram using the energy cut method
      - EDM: plots the average vertical angle as a function of time. 
     (- test: used for a single time snapshot, good for debugging)
2. n_events: the total number of events to generate. 
3. t_start and t_end: define the time range over which to generate events. 

# WiggleFitter.py

Run this on the output text files generated by gm2Sim to fit the wiggle plot or vertical angle oscillation. Calculates parameters, their errors, and the chi-squared of the fit.
